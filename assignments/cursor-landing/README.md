## What Was Recreated

The following sections were recreated to closely match the Cursor landing page (desktop-first):

1. Top Navigation Bar
2. Hero Section
3. Trusted By / Logos
4. Feature Sections (3 blocks, alternating layout)
5. Feature Cards Section
6. Testimonials
7. Use Cases / Stories
8. Changelog / Updates
9. Team / About
10. Final CTA
11. Footer (multi-column)

The focus was on **structure, spacing, hierarchy, and visual accuracy**, not creativity or interactivity.

## Tech Stack & Constraints

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- No JavaScript
- No Tailwind / frameworks
- No animations
- Desktop-only layout

---

## Fonts Used

- Primary font: **Cursor Gothics** (via Cursor Fonts)
- Font weights aligned to original hierarchy (Regular, Medium, SemiBold, Bold)

---

## Color Palette (Approx.)

Colors were sampled visually from the original site and adjusted for consistency.

## Notes
